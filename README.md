# Optical_Tweezer_Automation
A project focused on using OpenCV to track microscopic beads, control the ESP301 Motion controller to follow the beads, and then trap the beads using infrared lasers. This project seeks to automate a large stretch of the optical tweezers functionality in order to increase the throughput of single molecule biophysics data collection.
